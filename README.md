Student Management System (SMS) is designed for colleges and schools, currently customized for Nalbari Polytechnic (Assam) with three branches: CSE (Computer Science &amp; Eng), EL (Electrical Eng), and PT (Printing Technology). The system is structured for these branches but can be easily modified to fit other institutions.
